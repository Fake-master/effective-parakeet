# effective-parakeet
Quite an unusual name, isn't it? GitHub actually suggested it. Anyway, this is a Minecraft script addon. It use the latest beta API. To use it in-game, enabling beta experimental is necessary. With this Minecraft addon, you can acquire a poison effect by spending experience levels.

### How to use this?
Type in the chat `#<effect_name> <duration: int>`.
Duration is in **minutes**, and here is an example of how to use it:
`#night_vision 5`.
**The amount of experience levels needed depends on your duration.** In this case, I'll be getting the night vision effect for 5 minutes in exchange for 5 experience levels. You can get **any potion effect** using this.
