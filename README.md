# effective-parakeet

Quite an unusual name, isn't it? GitHub :octocat: actually suggested it. Anyway, this is a Minecraft script addon. It use the latest beta API. To use it in-game, enabling beta experimental is necessary. With this Minecraft addon, you can acquire a potion effect by spending experience levels.


## Usage/Examples
Type in the chat 

`#<effect_name> <minutes: int>`.

Here is an example: `#night_vision 5`.

**The amount of experience levels needed depends on your duration.** In this case, I'll be getting the night vision effect for 5 minutes in exchange for 5 experience levels. You can get **any potion effect** using this.
